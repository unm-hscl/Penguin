# Penguin
\Penguin\Matlab shows various folders. The folders \EigenValues via Error Trajectory RKHS &
\Error Trajectory Frequency Analysis have their own respective readme(s).

\Graphs and Figures has various graphs and figures

\Matlab Data shows the original Penguin Workspace as well as a folder that shows the
Novices01-05 and their timescaled values including downsample factors of log 9, log 15 and
log 30.

\Optimal Solution has a non-linear optimal control problem that is used throughout the 
various 
analysis - this is the original one provided by Adam Thorpe


\LTV_Model shows an analysis of a Spring-Mass-Damper System that is used to evaluate the RKHS 
approximation. It also has a Frobenius Norm Values.docx that shows the Frobenius norm values of
that system.

There are also three matlab scripts as follows:

1. Penguin_Analysis_Delayed_5S

2. Penguin_Analysis_Delayed_20S

3. Penguin_Analysis_Downsampled
